I went through the basics of Drupal CMS. As it requires PHP scripting language, it might take a while for me to understand PHP and get hands-on knowledge in Drupal.
I have spent considerable amount of time learning Spring Boot.
Currently, I am learning Spring cloud concepts and working on migrating static-code-service with member-service as a reference project.
Please assign some tasks related to spring boot migration.
